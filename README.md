# Description: Your Next Trip
#portfolio_sinatra

Your Next Trip is a simple MVC CRUD application using Sinatra and Activerecord.  It allows users who set up an account with the correct password parameters and a unique username to post about upcoming trips they have.  They can include information such as location, number of days they will be on the trip, budget, and whether or not they have transportation and accommodation booked.  Once their posts have saved, they can also edit or delete them.  They can also view all posts by all users.
